# AppleScriptExamples

This repository contains a number of examples that can be used (partially or fully) in What's Tuned
to provide additional information about the song your are playing.

For these scripts to run you will need:
- What's Tuned (get it from Apple's App Store for macOS)
- JSON Helper (get it from Apple's App Store for macOS)

Note that these are .applescript files (pure text). To optimize exceution performace you may want to 
save these files as .scpt files.
