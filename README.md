# AppleScriptExamples

This repository contains a number of examples that can be used (partially or fully) in What's Tuned
to provide additional information about the song your are playing.

For these scripts to run you will need:
- What's Tuned (get it from Apple's App Store for macOS)
- JSON Helper (get it from Apple's App Store for macOS)

Note that these are .applescript files (pure text). To optimise execution performance you may want to 
save these files as .scpt files.

Example 1.applescript
This example shows you how to get a wikipage extract from Wikipedia for the artist and a link to the lyrics on LyricWikia and format the output in the same way as it is done by default in What's Tuned.

Example 2.applescript
This example shows you how to build a list of links to lyrics on different websites (LyricWikia.com, MusiXmatch.com, MakeItPersonal.co, AZLyrics.com)

Example 3.applescript
Example 3 is showing the code needed to download album cover artwork from a suggested url. This suggestion is comming either from Spotify or the iTunes Store.
